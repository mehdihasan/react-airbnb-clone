But, we dont forget that a good contact with a country needs the pleasure of good food. Greece's fresh products taste like nowhere else.... Lets sit around an ouzo glass and try different mezes, feta cheese with home made fresh olive oil and origan. At breakfast, fresh orange juice, greek yougourt with thyme honey, and so on...

You are in the heart of Athens - Acropolis, Syntagma, Panathenaic Stadium, are all in walking distance -, yet you can find yourself in quiet streets with cats playing, birds singing and if you turn your head towards south you can even see the sea!! There is a picturesque little cafe' just around the corner where artists often meet, a great fish bar, bio-grocery and supermarkets, all in about 4 min walk. There is rich night life too. At 400 meters there are two different squares, attracting quite different types of people. You can see for yourself and choose :)  If you like jogging, then you will absolutely enjoy running in Panathenaic Stadium, a stadium which dates back in 359 B.C. and was renewed in 1896 for the Olympics.

On the north borders of Mets lies the Panathenaic Stadium where the first modern Olympic Games were held in 1896. Unique thanks to its' many delightful old Athenian neoclassical houses dating from the 19th century, Mets is renowned for its' quiet pedestrian streets, the gardens and parks surrounding it. Right in the heart of Athens, this quiet and extremely safe residential district is home to many Greek artists, actors and writers.

                "host_about": "Hi there! We are a couple from Athens. Spyros is a musician. He also builds a new musical instrument known as the 'handpan'. Nadia is an actress. She also teaches  theatrical clown workshops. Spyros is full of energy and fascinated by almost nearly everything. Nadia is the silent steady force and is forever smiling. On a Sunday Spyros will ride 150km on his bicycle to decompress whilst Nadia will relax in the hammock and take beautiful pictures of flowers and sunsets. We admire each other :) \n\nWhen we are free from performing and rehearsals we do enjoy the great outdoors, cozy nights at home cooking dinner with friends or the occasional cultural night out.  \n\nHaving the travel bug has led us to many places in and out of Greece. We are thrilled to meet new people, their culture and explore new places. We love exciting our taste sensory buds. Yes, we admit it. We love food and we do have a few suggestions for you. \n\nIt will be our pleasure helping you discover Athens - as well as it's hidden secrets - and get a true understanding of the Athenian vibe.",

During the summer months I work in a local hotel  as this is one of the best ways to meet people, especially travellers...  and who knows, maybe we will meet at some point in time... I also love travelling, meeting new people, learning new cultures  - and just seeing as much of the world as I can. As a traveller myself, I know what it means to have good accommodation, friendly hosts and good information.  So with this in mind I hope that I can fullfill all these requirements and ensure that your stay in Athens will be as you expecteded.\nIt will be my pleasure to do whatever I can to meet all your needs so that you return home with the best memories.",
